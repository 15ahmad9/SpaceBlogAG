                        <h3>Why We Study Venus</h3>
                        <p>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, even though Mercury is twice as close to the
                            Sun and receives four times more solar energy. The reason? Venus' thick, carbon dioxide
                            atmosphere causes a runaway greenhouse effect. At the surface, Venus has an atmosphere 50
                            times denser
                            than Earth's, and average surface temperatures of 470 degrees Celsius (878 degrees
                            Fahrenheit) —
                            hot enough to melt lead.</p>
                        <p> Venus is currently inhospitable, but it wasn't always that
                            way. Missions there have observed granite-like rocks that require abundant water to
                            form. In the solar system's early days when the Sun was cooler, scientists think the planet
                            may have had liquid water on the surface for 2 billion years — far longer than Mars, which
                            had
                            liquid water for a relatively shorter 300 million years. Water is the key to life as we know
                            it, so did Venus once have life?</p>
                        <p> Scientists including Planetary Society co-founder Carl Sagan have predicted that
                            life could currently exist in Venus' upper atmosphere, which has Earth-like temperatures and
                            pressures roughly 50
                            kilometers (31 miles) above the planet's surface. There, mysterious dark patches absorb more
                            than half the planet's solar energy. In 2020 scientists announced they had found
                            phosphine, a chemical strongly associated with life, in Venus's
                            clouds — though the existence of the signal is currently being reviewed.</p>
                        <p> We don't know how Venus transformed from a potentially
                            habitable world to its current hellish state. By studying Venus, scientists learn how
                            Earth-like planets evolve and what
                            conditions exist on Earth-sized exoplanets. Venus also helps scientists
                            model Earth's climate, and serves as a cautionary tale on how dramatically a planet's
                            climate can change.</p>

                        <h3>How we study Venus</h3>
                        <p>Venus was the first planet to be visited by a spacecraft. In 1962, NASA's Mariner 2 flew by
                            the planet and discovered it was a hot world with no self-generated magnetic field. The
                            Soviet Union became the world leader in early Venus exploration after that, sending
                            multiple atmospheric probes and as many as ten landers to the planet. To this day, they
                            remain the only nation to have landed spacecraft on the surface and transmitted both data
                            and
                            images back to Earth.</p>

                        <p>Due to thick clouds, it is impossible to see Venus' surface without radar.
                            NASA's Magellan orbiter, launched in 1990, used radar to map Venus' surface at
                            the highest resolution to date. Magellan revealed that all of the planet's impact craters
                            are formed within the last 700 million years. This implies that Venus' surface was
                            completely reshaped by
                            a worldwide volcanic event in its recent geologic past—but.</p>

                        <p>Magellan also found no sign of plate tectonics. On Earth, plate tectonics is a process in
                            which sections of the planet's outer crust glide over the mantle — the rocky inner layer
                            above the
                            core — allowing heat to escape through volcanism. Since we think Venus's interior is similar
                            to Earth's, the lack of plate tectonics means that volcanoes on Venus must work differently
                            than on Earth.</p>

                        <p>The European Space Agency launched the Venus Express orbiter in 2006. By
                            observing hotspots on the surface and changing sulfur dioxide levels
                            in the atmosphere over 6 years, the spacecraft collected the best
                            evidence yet of active volcanism on Venus. Venus Express also discovered
                            granite-like rocks across the planet that require abundant liquid water
                            to form, solidifying the idea of the planet having past oceans.</p>

                        <p>Japan's Akatsuki spacecraft is the only probe currently orbiting
                            Venus. It studies Venus's atmosphere in frequencies of light that human
                            eyes cannot see, which helps scientists paint a better picture of what's
                            happening above the planet's surface. These images can be processed to create
                            beautiful enhanced-color pictures of the planet.</p>

                        <h3>Upcoming Venus missions</h3>
                        <p> NASA's DAVINCI mission will launch between 2028 and 2030. It consists of an orbiter and an
                            atmospheric descent probe. The probe will make high precision measurements of trace
                            gases in Venus' atmosphere, helping firmly determine how much water Venus' oceans had
                            and how long they existed.</p>
                        <p> NASA's VERITAS orbiter will launch between 2028 and 2030. It will have a radar instrument
                            with up to 100 times
                            higher resolution than Magellan. This will give scientists a better handle on Venus'
                            geology and evolution and also reveal why the planet lacks large-scale plate tectonics.</p>
                        <p> The European Space Agency's EnVision mission will launch no earlier than 2031. The orbiter
                            will provide a
                            comprehensive view of Venus, from the core all the way to its upper
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p> India aims to launch a Venus orbiter called Shukrayaan
                            in December 2024 equipped with a radar and infrared camera to map the surface. It will
                            have a payload capacity of about 100 kilograms and study Venus for four
                            years from a polar orbit of 200 x 600 kilometers. The spacecraft will
                            carry both Indian and international science instruments. One, called
                            VIRAL (Venus Infrared Atmospheric Gases Linker), will be co-developed
                            by the French and Russian space agencies.</p>
