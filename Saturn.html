                        <h3>Why we study Saturn</h3>
                        <p>The real Lord of the Rings is Saturn, a massive outer planet boasting a set of rings
                            about 27 Earths wide. Being a gas giant like
                            Jupiter, Saturn shares many of its attributes: a strong magnetic field generated by churning
                            metallic hydrogen deep inside, raging storms in its gaseous upper atmosphere, and a
                            diversity of
                            planet-like moons that are worlds unto themselves.
                            Saturn's rings and larger moons are visible even from small backyard telescopes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Saturn was born right after Jupiter, roughly 4.5 billion years ago in
                            the solar system's early days. Both planets probably formed closer to
                            the Sun and then migrated out to their current positions about 4 billion
                            years ago. Their gravity likely lofted asteroids and comets all over
                            the solar system, some of which slammed into early Earth and may have
                            brought water here.</p>
                        <p>We know of more than 4,000 exoplanets — worlds
                            orbiting other stars — and the statistics show us that most stars have
                            planets. Many are Jupiter and Saturn-like words close to their stars,
                            supporting the idea that our own gas giants moved during the solar
                            system's early days. One exoplanet we've found appears to have rings 200
                            times wider than Saturn's! By studying Saturn and comparing it to similar exoplanets, we
                            learn how solar systems evolve.</p>
                        <h4>What are Saturn's rings like up close?</h4>
                        <p>Saturn's rings are made from chunks of mostly water ice ranging in
                            size from dust specks to houses to mountains. The largest chunks, known
                            as moonlets, have enough gravity to clear small gaps, distort
                            the rings' shape, and cause wave-like
                            disturbances.</p>
                        <h4>Where did Saturn's rings come from?</h4>
                        <p>Scientists think Saturn's
                            rings formed when either a large moon got
                            too close to Saturn and was ripped apart due to intense gravitational
                            forces or that the rings are simply leftover material from the time
                            Saturn formed. The rings are being gradually pulled into Saturn and
                            will disappear completely within 300 million years. We don't know why the other giant
                            planets
                            Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune don't have such a stunning set.</p>
                        <p>Like our other 3 outer planets, Saturn is a solar system unto itself, with
                            many compelling targets for study. The ringed planet has at least 82
                            moons, the largest of which are active, planet-like worlds.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Titan</strong></p>
                        <p>Larger than Mercury, Titan has an orange, hazy atmosphere that was
                            probably similar to Earth's before life arose here around 3.5 billion
                            years ago. Complex, organic molecules—one of the building blocks for
                            life as we know it—form Titan's atmosphere and rain from the skies. By
                            studying Titan, we can learn the possible starting ingredients for life
                            on Earth and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The surface is strikingly similar to Earth, with some key differences: Titan has mountains
                            and dunes made of mostly ice rather than rock, and rivers, lakes and seas filled with
                            methane and ethane instead of liquid water. A
                            liquid-water ocean probably exists beneath the surface, though we don't know if the
                            chemical mix is conducive to life, or if there's an energy source like the hydrothermal
                            vents in Earth's oceans.</p>
                        <p><strong>Enceladus</strong></p>
                        <p>At just 500 kilometers (310 miles) wide, Enceladus could fit
                            comfortably inside the U.S. state of Arizona. But this moon has a big
                            secret under its icy crust: a saltwater ocean, which leaks into space
                            via geysers on the surface to form one of Saturn's outer rings. We know
                            the ocean contains complex organic materials. Could it also contain
                            life?</p>
                        <p><strong>Mimas</strong></p>
                        <p>Mimas boasts a massive crater that makes it eerily similar to the Death Star from Star
                            Wars. It too may have a subsurface ocean, though material from the ocean does not
                            appear to leak up to the surface.</p>
                        <p><strong>The photogenic oddballs</strong></p>
                        <p>Some of Saturn's smaller moons are among the most photogenic in our solar system. Dione and
                            Rhea are cratered
                            snowball worlds with rocky cores. Hyperion
                            looks like a giant sponge or coral reef. Iapetus is
                            two-faced, with an icy half and a dark half coated with material coming from the comet-like
                            moon
                            Phoebe.
                            And then there's Pan, a moon whose gravity has grabbed enough material from Saturn's rings
                            to make it look like a
                            flying saucer!</p>

                        <h3>How we study Saturn</h3>
                        <p>Christiaan Huygens first glimpsed Saturn's rings and the planet's largest moon, Titan,
                            through a telescope in the 1650s. Shortly thereafter,
                            Giovanni Cassini found 4 more moons and the planet's largest ring gap,
                            now named the Cassini Division in his honor.</p>
                        <p>NASA's Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to visit Saturn, flying
                            past the planet in 1979 and revealing yet another outer ring. Voyager 1
                            flew by a year later, swinging by Titan to get a good look at the moon's
                            thick orange atmosphere. Voyager 2 flew closer to Saturn itself,
                            discovering the planet's upper atmosphere was a chilly -200 degrees
                            Celsius (-328 degrees Fareneheit), and finding trace amounts of ammonia
                            crystals that give Saturn its pale yellow hue.</p>
                        <p>In 2004, Cassini-Huygens, a joint robotic mission by NASA and the
                            European Space Agency, became the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn. One
                            of the most revolutionary space missions of all time, Cassini spent 13
                            Earth years—almost half a Saturn year—watching how the planet and its
                            moons changed with the seasons as they orbited the Sun.</p>
                        <p>On Saturn itself, Cassini studied the hexagonal storm at the
                            planet's north pole first seen by Voyager 2 in 1981, and discovered
                            a smaller, circular vortex on the south pole. The north pole storm is
                            remarkably symmetric and has a central eyewall akin to Earth's
                            hurricanes. Cassini also observed a planet-wide
                            megastorm that appears roughly every Saturn year—30 Earth years. The spacecraft also mapped
                            the structure and shape of Saturn's magnetic field and narrowed down the planet's rotation
                            rate—less than half an Earth day, even though Saturn is 9.5 Earths wide!
                        </p>
                        <p>Shortly after its arrival at Saturn, Cassini released the European
                            Huygens probe, which landed on Titan's surface in 2005—a first for any
                            world in the outer solar system. As Huygens descended, it gathered data
                            on the complex chemistry
                            happening in Titan's atmosphere. Post-landing, the probe took the first
                            ever images from Titan's surface and survived for 2 hours, despite
                            frigid temperatures of about -180 degrees Celsius (-292 degrees
                            Fahrenheit).
                        </p>
                        <p>As it performed long, swooping orbits around Saturn, Cassini
                            repeatedly buzzed many of the planet's moons. The spacecraft's
                            cloud-penetrating radar pierced Titan's orange haze, allowing scientists
                            to create a global
                            geologic surface map. Gravity measurements by Cassini and radio measurements by
                            Huygens
                            showed that Titan likely harbors
                            a large subsurface ocean of water. Cassini also directly imaged Enceladus spewing water from
                            its
                            subsurface ocean into space. Mission operators flew the spacecraft
                            directly through a plume, leading to the discovery
                            of organic materials using Cassini's onboard mass spectrometer, which determines the
                            elemental makeup of materials passing through it.</p>
                        <p>Cassini performed what NASA dubbed the "Grand Finale" of its mission
                            in 2017: a number of passes between Saturn and its inner rings. In these
                            close encounters, Cassini measured the mass of the rings based on how
                            the spacecraft was gently tugged towards them, and found them to weigh
                            less than even the small moon Mimas, which is just 200 kilometers (124
                            miles) wide. Combined with the fact that the rings are bright,
                            undarkened by constant space weathering, this hints that they are less than 100 million
                            years old—very young in geological terms. Cassini ended its
                            mission with an intentional plunge into Saturn in September 2017, becoming a
                            permanent
                            part of the planet it was sent to study.</p>
                        <p>Cassini left an impressive legacy for future missions. As an
                            all-purpose, flagship spacecraft, it was designed to answer general
                            questions about Saturn and its moons, and help us figure out questions
                            for new missions to answer.</p>
                        <p>The next—and at the moment, only—spacecraft heading to the Saturn
                            system is Dragonfly. Dragonfly is a NASA mission to Titan scheduled to
                            launch in 2027. The spacecraft is an 8-bladed
                            drone-like craft called a quadcopter that will make short flights around
                            the surface.</p>
                        <p>Dragonfly will study the chemicals that rain from Titan's atmosphere
                            onto the surface. Because we think Titan's atmosphere is similar to
                            Earth's when life arose around 3.5 billion years ago, the mission will
                            help us understand possible starting ingredients for life here and
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Life as we know it needs 3 things: an energy source like sunlight, a
                            liquid solvent like water, and complex, organic molecules that bond with
                            one another. Titan has the latter, but it's very cold and has methane
                            and ethane on the surface instead of water. Dragonfly will, in a sense,
                            be studying an alternate version of Earth to see what chemical processes
                            are happening, and how that relates to both life as we know it and
                            possible forms of life unlike anything we've ever imagined.</p>
