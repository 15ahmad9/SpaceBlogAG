                    <div class="container-med w-full px-6">
                        <h3>Why we study Uranus</h3>
                        <p>There's no getting around it: for English speakers, Uranus is the butt of all planet jokes.
                            But there's much more to this world than potty humor. Like its cousin Neptune, Uranus has
                            only
                            been visited by
                            one spacecraft. Yet most of the planets
                            we've found around other stars are Uranus and Neptune-sized, so learning this mysterious
                            world teaches us about other solar systems and whether our own is unique.</p>
                        <p>Uniquely among our planets, Uranus and the orbits of its rings and moons float through space
                            sideways. How this happened isn't known for sure. Another large world could have crashed
                            into
                            the planet long ago, or a larger, previous ring system could have caused Uranus to wobble
                            and tip over. Figuring out what happened would give scientists important insights into how
                            planets evolve.</p>
                        <p>Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, with traces of
                            methane that
                            absorb red light and give the planet its cyan appearance. Beneath the atmosphere is an
                            exotic slush of partially frozen water, ammonia, and methane. For this reason, we call
                            Uranus an
                            ice giant, even though the ice isn't like anything you'd put in your drink: super-compressed
                            ice
                            can reach temperatures of thousands of degrees!</p>
                        <p>Uranus lies 20 times further from the sun than Earth. At this distance, the disk of gas and
                            dust
                            that formed our solar system 4.5 billion years ago was probably too thin to form Uranus.
                            Like
                            Neptune, Uranus was probably born closer to the sun before migrating outward. Piecing
                            together
                            what happened would tell us what the early solar
                            system was like before life arose on Earth.</p>
                        <p>Uranus' five largest moons in order of ascending size are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Oberon,
                            and Titania.
                            The latter two may be warmed enough by gravitational tugs from Uranus and other moons to
                            create liquid water beneath their surfaces. Investigating this possibility would help us
                            learn
                            about the possibilities for life far outside the habitable zone, the
                            not-too-hot, not-too-cold region around stars where liquid can exist on planetary surfaces.

                        <h3>How we study Uranus</h3>
                        <p>Like Neptune, only one spacecraft has ever visited Uranus. Missions to the outer planets
                            require
                            long travel times, which typically means higher costs. The only spacecraft ever to visit
                            Uranus
                            was Voyager 2, which launched in 1977 and used a rare planetary alignment that only happens
                            every 175 years to visit all four outer planets.</p>
                        <p>When Voyager 2 swung by Uranus in 1986, it discovered new moons and rings and measured the
                            planet's magnetic field. Because the moons' orbits sat sideways compared to
                            Voyager 2's trajectory, the spacecraft only got a close look at
                            Miranda, revealing a world scarred by grooves and divots and boasting what could be
                            the
                            tallest cliff in the solar
                            system.
                        </p>
                        <p>With no new Uranus missions since, scientists have been relying on ground-based
                            telescopes
                            and the Hubble Space Telescope
                            to
                            monitor the planet. Hubble has tracked the
                            planet's changing seasons for years, while recent ground images have provided new
                            insight into the planet's weather patterns.</p>
                        <p>The 2023-2032
                            Planetary Science Decadal Survey — a report produced every 10 years by the U.S.
                            scientific community to guide future NASA missions — recommends sending a spacecraft to
                            Uranus
                            as the highest priority. If commissioned, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP) mission
                            will paint
                            us a clear picture of where and how Uranus formed, and how it subsequently evolved.
                            Because of the two ice giants' similarity, these insights would also likely apply to
                            Neptune.
                            The mission would also provide us with missing information necessary to understand the
                            migration
                            of the gas giants and the connected evolution of our
                            solar
                            system and early Earth.</p>
                        <p>In the best-case scenario, UOP could launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in
                            2031 or 2032 and reach Uranus 12 to 13 years later. There's strong international
                            interest in the mission too. The 2021
                            report of ESA's Voyage
                            2050 Senior Committee recommends that the agency contributes to an ice giant mission
                            led
                            by an international partner, similar to how ESA provided the Huygens
                            landing probe to Saturn's moon Titan as part of Cassini.<br></p>
