                        <h3>Why we study Jupiter</h3>
                        <p>Named after the king of the gods in Roman mythology, Jupiter is a
                            stunning sight to behold. Its red, orange, and yellow swirls, spots, and bands are visible
                            even
                            from small backyard telescopes. Astronomers have observed the planet's Great Red Spot, a
                            raging
                            storm larger than Earth,
                            for at least 200 years.</p>
                        <p>Jupiter was the first planet in our solar system to form. It was
                            probably born much closer to the Sun before migrating to its current
                            position about 4 billion years ago, scattering asteroids and comets with
                            its gravity in the process. Some of those asteroids and comets slammed
                            into early Earth, possibly bringing water here in the process — the key
                            ingredient for life as we know it.</p>
                        <p>Many exoplanets — planets
                            in other solar systems — we have discovered are Jupiter-like worlds close
                            to their stars, reinforcing the idea that our own solar system's large
                            planets have moved from their original positions. By studying Jupiter
                            and comparing it to similar exoplanets, we learn how solar systems
                            evolve and the possibilities for life elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Jupiter has a faint ring system and at least 79 moons, four of which are active,
                            planet-like worlds ranging in size from just
                            smaller than Earth's Moon to larger than Mercury. All but Io likely have liquid-water oceans
                            under their surfaces, making them possible havens for life. Europa's ocean in particular may
                            be the most biologically promising environment beyond Earth for life. Jupiter challenges our
                            perceptions about where life can exist in the universe.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Meet the Moons</strong></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Io</strong> is the solar system's most volcanically active world. Because of
                                friction caused by the gravity of Jupiter on one side
                                and Europa and Ganymede on the other, it is molten nearly all the way
                                through and continuously erupts in at least a dozen locations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Europa</strong> has a thick crust of water ice with a liquid
                                saltwater ocean beneath, warmed by gravitational tugs from Jupiter and
                                Ganymede. On Earth, life exists in the deepest, darkest parts of our oceans near
                                hydrothermal vents releasing heat from our planet's core.
                                Could something similar be happening in Europa's ocean?</li>
                            <li><strong>Ganymede</strong> is the largest moon in the solar system and the only moon with
                                a magnetic field, likely produced by its churning liquid-iron core. It too is
                                geologically
                                active due to gravitational tugs, which gives it a subsurface ocean. More study of this
                                moon is needed to determine whether its ocean is likely to be habitable to life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Callisto,</strong> the outermost of Jupiter's large moons,
                                does not experience enough gravitational pushing and pulling to heat its
                                interior like the other moons. Yet there is evidence
                                of a subsurface liquid-water ocean,
                                likely due to high pressure from its thick ice shell above and
                                impurities in the ocean that keep the water liquified at cool
                                temperatures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Jupiter and its moons are essentially a miniature solar system
                            unto themselves and can together teach us a lot. Every branch of
                            planetary science has questions that can be answered here: atmospheric
                            scientists can study storm dynamics on Jupiter, geologists can examine
                            diverse terrains on moons with active volcanoes and geysers, and
                            astrobiologists can search for life.</p>

                        <h3>How we study Jupiter</h3>
                        <p>Jupiter has long been studied from Earth-based telescopes. Galileo
                            Galilei's observations of Jupiter's moons in the early 1600s
                            revolutionized humanity's understanding of the universe by showing that
                            not every celestial object orbits the Earth, which was the leading
                            theory at the time.</p>
                        <p>NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft made the first Jupiter flyby in 1973,
                            returning the first close-up images of Jupiter and discovering the planet's huge magnetic
                            field
                            that traps charged particles from the Sun,
                            creating a deadly radiation field. Spacecraft exploring Jupiter must carry radiation
                            shielding to
                            survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>NASA's legendary Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft flew past Jupiter in
                            1979, capturing up-close views of the Galilean moons that revealed they were complex worlds
                            unto
                            themselves, with volcanoes, oceans, and other significant features. The probes also saw
                            Jupiter's faint ring system.
                            The planet finally received its own, dedicated mission when NASA's
                            Galileo spacecraft arrived in 1995 and orbited Jupiter until 2003.
                            Galileo dropped a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere to measure its composition and discovered
                            evidence of Europa's saltwater ocean.</p>
                        <p><strong>What's under Jupiter's beautiful clouds?</strong> <br> When Jupiter formed, it likely
                            had
                            a large,
                            rock-and-metal core. But as the planet gobbled up leftover gases from the solar system's
                            formation, intense pressures may have dissolved the core into an exotic substance called
                            metallic hydrogen. The most recent data from NASA's Juno spacecraft suggests there is no
                            distinct core.</p>
                        <p>Though Jupiter's immense gravitational field wreaked havoc during the solar system's early
                            days, today it shepherds the orbits of asteroids and helps protect the inner solar system.
                            Comet
                            Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacted Jupiter in 1994, just as the Galileo spacecraft was approaching
                            the planet. Galileo teamed up with Earth-based telescopes to watch the impact, and the
                            observations taught us valuable lessons about the importance of defending our own planet
                            from
                            asteroids and comets.</p>
                        <p>In 2016, NASA's Juno spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter to find
                            out what's at the giant planet's core, map its magnetic field, and
                            measure how much water and ammonia are present in the deeper levels of
                            its atmosphere. These measurements are helping us learn more about
                            Jupiter's formation and evolution.</p>
                        <p>The European Space Agency's JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) mission will launch in 2022 to
                            explore Jupiter's Galilean moons. JUICE
                            will orbit Ganymede in the late-2020s after flybys of Europa and
                            Callisto, aiming to figure out whether the moons' subsurface oceans could support life.
                            NASA's Europa Clipper mission will launch in the mid-2020s to try and answer the same
                            question at Europa by performing a
                            detailed survey of the moon.

                            once-a-decade effort represents a consensus opinion of top scientific
                            goals in the solar system, and, once released, requires support from the
                            public and organizations like The Planetary Society to ensure those
                            priorities are funded. Europa Clipper was a top
                            recommendation of a prior decadal survey, yet required years of steady advocacy to become
                            reality.
