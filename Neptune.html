                        <h3>Why we study Neptune</h3>
                        <p>Neptune, along with its cousin Uranus, is
                            the least-explored planet in our solar system, having been visited by a spacecraft only
                            once.
                            Yet we've found more Neptune-sized worlds
                            orbiting other stars than any other type of planet. In order to understand
                            other solar systems and figure out whether our own is unique, we need to learn more about
                            the
                            windy blue world in our own backyard.</p>
                        <p>Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere consists
                            mostly of hydrogen and helium, but it also has methane that absorbs red light, giving it a
                            deep
                            blue hue. Beneath the atmosphere lies an ocean of water, ammonia, and methane, squeezed by
                            intense pressures into a semi-solid state. For this reason, we call Neptune an ice giant,
                            though
                            the ice isn't anything like what you'd find in your freezer, with temperatures likely
                            reaching
                            thousands of degrees! Electric currents flowing through this icy-hot ocean may be
                            responsible
                            for powering Neptune's strong and unusually complex magnetic field.</p>
                        <p>Where Neptune formed and how it got its water isn't clear. The disk of dust and gas that
                            formed
                            our solar system probably didn't contain enough material to form Neptune at its current
                            location, 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth. Like the other outer planets, it was
                            probably born closer to the Sun before moving outward, though the Sun would have evaporated
                            its
                            water had Neptune been too close. By figuring out
                            where
                            Neptune was born and how the planet evolved, scientists learn what conditions in the early
                            solar
                            system were like, around the time life arose on Earth.</p>
                        <p>Neptune has 14 known moons, half of which were likely captured by the planet's gravity rather
                            than forming in place. Only one moon, Triton, is big enough to be spherical. It has
                            planet-like characteristics
                            similar to Pluto such as a complex icy surface and thin nitrogen atmosphere and may have
                            started
                            off as a free-roaming dwarf planet. Geysers of nitrogen erupt from Triton's surface that may
                            be
                            coming from a subsurface water ocean. Future missions would help confirm whether the ocean
                            exists and whether it might be habitable to life as we know it.</p>
                        <p>Just like Saturn, Neptune has a set of rings shepherded by small moons and made up of cold,
                            icy
                            particles. But its outermost ring is not complete,
                            comprising
                            five distinct arcs. Scientists think the planet's moon Galatea prevents particles in these
                            arcs
                            from spreading out to complete the ring but no one knows for sure.</p>

                        <h3>How we study Neptune</h3>
                        <p>It takes a spacecraft a long time to reach Neptune, and we've only done it once. NASA
                            launched
                            the nuclear-powered Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1977 to fly past every giant planet in the outer
                            solar system, taking advantage of a rare planetary alignment that
                            only happens every 175 years. Voyager 2 passed Neptune in August 1989.</p>
                        <p>Its instruments measured an atmospheric temperature of -220 degrees Celsius (-360 degrees
                            Fahrenheit), with wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometers per hour, possibly driven from
                            heat
                            radiating deep within the planet. Voyager 2 also made the definitive observations of the
                            planet's rings and saw storms raging across the face of the planet, the largest being an
                            Earth-sized anticyclone similar to Jupiter's famous Great
                            Red Spot.</p>
                        <p>Just like at Uranus, Voyager 2 found that Neptune's magnetic field doesn't cleanly intersect
                            the
                            planet's core and is tilted significantly away from the north and south poles. No other
                            planet
                            in our solar system has such complex magnetic fields as the ice giants. Voyager 2 also
                            revealed
                            Triton's relatively young, crater-free surface, indicating geologic processes at work.
                            Further
                            attesting this were fractures, ridges, and
                            lava plains</a> in the north, as well as nitrogen geysers in the south that hinted at a
                            possible subsurface ocean.</p>
                        <p>With no new space missions to Neptune since Voyager 2, scientists have relied on the Hubble
                            Space
                            Telescope and large ground-based
                            telescopes</a> to regularly observe the planet. The observations have discovered more moons,
                            monitored seasonal
                            storms, and even detected gases
                            in Triton's thin atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>A Neptune orbiter would
                            help us better understand ice giants by measuring the planet's magnetic field, mapping
                            gravity
                            variations and atmospheric wobbles to understand the core, and observing how heat is
                            radiated on
                            the planet's night side. A probe dropped into Neptune's frigid atmosphere could precisely
                            measure the composition of gases, helping scientists figure out where Neptune formed and how
                            it evolved.</p>
                        <p>China is considering
                            a Voyager-like mission to interstellar space that would launch in 2024 and make a
                            Neptune
                            flyby in 2038. The spacecraft would include an atmospheric probe. NASA is considering
                            a low-cost Neptune mission called TRIDENT that would perform a single flyby of Triton,
                            mapping
                            the moon's surface and exploring whether it has a subsurface ocean. The existence of such an
                            ocean would open up possibilities for habitable worlds very distant from their stars.</p>
                        <p>The 2023-2032
                            Planetary Science Decadal Survey — a report produced every 10 years by the U.S.
                            scientific community to guide future NASA missions — recommends sending a spacecraft to
                            Uranus
                            as the highest priority. If commissioned, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP) mission
                            launching
                            in the 2030s will paint
                            us a clear picture of where and how Uranus formed, and how it subsequently evolved.
                            Because of the two ice giants' similarity, these insights would also likely apply to
                            Neptune. The mission would also provide us with missing information necessary to
                            understand
                            the migration of the gas giants and the connected evolution of our solar
                            system and early Earth.</p>
