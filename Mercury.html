                        <h3>Why We Study Mercury</h3>
                        <p>Mercury doesn't always receive a lot of attention. The innermost planet to the Sun is smaller
                            than both Jupiter's moon
                            Ganymede and Saturn's moon Titan. It has been overshadowed by worlds like Mars that may have
                            once harbored life,
                            and planets that are solar systems unto themselves like Jupiter and Saturn. </p>
                        <p>Mercury is a world of extremes. Its surface appears old, cratered, and undisturbed by recent
                            geologic activity. Yet it has a magnetic field, which is normally caused by a molten core
                            that
                            should, in turn, cause surface changes. Thanks to the nearby Sun, Mercury's surface
                            temperatures
                            reach 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) — yet like our Moon, water
                            ice exists inside permanently shadowed craters at the poles. </p>
                        <p>Mercury is particularly interesting to scientists who study exoplanets, planets that
                            orbit
                            other
                            stars. Thousands of known exoplanets orbit extremely close to their stars. By studying
                            Mercury
                            right here in our backyard, we can better understand what these close-orbiting worlds might
                            be
                            like. </p>
                        <p>Scientists aren't sure why Mercury's core makes up 85% of the planet's volume — much more
                            than Earth's, which makes up just 15%. The answer may help us understand the
                            possibilities for different types of planets and how our solar system evolved.</p>

                        <h3>How We Study Mercury</h3>
                        <p>Studying Mercury is a challenge because it actually takes more energy for a spacecraft to
                            reach
                            Mercury than Pluto. Mercury is the fastest-orbiting planet in our solar system — it blazes
                            around the Sun at 48 kilometers (30 miles) per second. Missions trying to enter orbit there
                            typically fly past Earth, Venus, and/or Mercury itself, using gravitational nudges to adjust
                            their trajectories.</p>
                        <p>Only three spacecraft have ever visited Mercury. In the 1970s, NASA's Mariner 10 made three
                            flybys of the planet — seeing the same side each time — revealing its crater-ridden surface
                            and
                            magnetic field. No spacecraft visited again until NASA's MESSENGER became the first
                            spacecraft to
                            orbit Mercury in 2011.</p>
                        <p>MESSENGER gave us a more complete
                            picture of the planet than ever before. The spacecraft revealed
                            Mercury to have an unusually large core and an offset magnetic field. MESSENGER
                            also
                            found the planet to be surprisingly rich in volatiles, elements that evaporate at room
                            temperature, including finding ample evidence of water ice on Mercury's poles.
                            This helped scientists
                            rule out many of its previously suggested formation models while also advancing our
                            knowledge of how the solar system
                            formed and evolved.</p>
                        <p>We also study Mercury using powerful Earth-based radar telescopes,
                            which zap the planet with energy and measure the reflections. The
                            Arecibo Observatory radio telescope created maps of water ice inside Mercury's
                            permanently shadowed craters.</p>
                        <p>The only current Mercury mission is BepiColombo, a joint Japanese-European mission that
                            launched in 2018 and will arrive
                            in Mercury orbit in 2025. BepiColombo will help us understand why
                            Mercury has such a large core, and how the planet generates its magnetic
                            field. BepiColombo will also allow planetary scientists to better
                            understand why some planets have internally generated magnetic fields
                            (Mercury and Earth) while others don't (Venus and Mars). On Earth, our
                            magnetic field protects us from the solar wind, which would otherwise damage our planet's
                            atmosphere.</p>
