                        <h3>Why we study Mars</h3>
                        <p>David Bowie wasn't the first person to ask <strong>"Is there life on Mars?"</strong> <br>
                            This
                            question has intrigued humans for centuries. Early telescope observations in the 18th and
                            19th centuries seemed to show a planet not all that different from Earth, with ice caps,
                            seasons,
                            and features that were mistaken for seas and artificial canals. A few scientists even
                            thought
                            that Mars was inhabited by intelligent life.</p>
                        <p>We now know that Mars is very <strong>cold and dry, with no breathable atmosphere and no
                                global
                                magnetic field</strong> to protect it from the Sun's radiation. But it wasn't always
                            that
                            way. Space missions have shown us that Mars once had liquid water on the surface and could
                            have
                            been hospitable to life as we know it. Today, there may still be life beneath the surface,
                            with
                            access to water and protection from radiation and extreme temperatures. <br></p>
                        <p>We know <strong>Mars was habitable to life as we know it for at least some periods of time
                                around
                                3 or 4 billion years ago</strong>. But we don't know whether the planet was warm and wet
                            long enough for life to arise, or mostly cold and dry with only brief intervals that could
                            have
                            supported life.</p>
                        <p><strong>How did Mars go from a potential life-supporting oasis to a cold, dry <br>desert?
                                Does life still flourish underground?</strong><br> The answers to these questions will
                            teach
                            us more about where we come from and whether we are alone in the cosmos.</p>

                        <h3>Missions to Mars</h3>
                        <p>Humans have sent more spacecraft to Mars than any other world beyond Earth. Today, there are
                            eleven&nbsp;missions operating on or around the planet, shaping&nbsp;the next generation of
                            exploration.</p>
                        <p>The United States and Soviet Union began sending robotic probes to
                            Mars in the 1960s. Many of those early attempts failed, until NASA's
                            Mariner 4 spacecraft successfully flew by Mars in 1965, revealing a
                            barren landscape. Later missions saw Earth-like deltas and canyons
                            suggesting that liquid water had shaped the surface.</p>
                        <p>The NASA Viking landers of the mid-1970s — the first to land on Mars successfully — tested
                            the
                            Martian soil to look for possible signs of life.
                            The results showed no clear evidence for the presence of living
                            microorganisms in the soil near the landing sites.</p>
                        <p>To determine whether or not life once existed on Mars — and possibly
                            still exists underground today — NASA initiated the Mars Exploration
                            Program in the mid-1990s to systematically explore the Red Planet. In
                            2000, the program adopted a goal to "follow the water." Because liquid water is essential to
                            life on Earth, the search for life elsewhere starts by looking in places where this key
                            ingredient exists or used to exist.</p>
                        <p>Orbital missions to Mars study the planet's atmosphere, map and
                            identify major geologic features, and determine the composition of
                            minerals and ice. Orbital missions are easier, technically speaking,
                            than landing on the surface, and, as a consequence, more affordable.
                            Orbital spacecraft can also serve as critical relay satellites for
                            surface spacecraft and future human missions. Besides Earth, Mars is the
                            only planet in the solar system with a global satellite communications
                            system.</p>
                        <p>Although much can be learned about Mars from orbit, for detailed observations we must land on
                            the
                            surface. Initially, this involved stationary landers that could analyze one location. But on
                            Earth,
                            geologists travel widely to study the composition of different types of
                            rock in order to reconstruct a complete picture of the planet's past. To
                            do this on Mars, NASA has&nbsp;developed a series of spacecraft with wheels
                            called rovers&nbsp;—&nbsp;Sojourner,&nbsp;Spirit
                            and&nbsp;Opportunity, Curiosity, and&nbsp; Perseverance&nbsp;—&nbsp;which
                            have proven to be highly effective in&nbsp;exploring the surface.</p>
                        <p>The next step in Mars exploration is returning
                            surface&nbsp;samples back to Earth.
                            Although rovers are highly capable mobile science labs, their tiny,
                            low-power instruments can't compete with larger, heavier versions back
                            on Earth. Bringing just a few small samples back to Earth will allow us
                            to dramatically advance our understanding of Mars—including whether it
                            may have supported life.</p>
                        <p>NASA's Perseverance rover began&nbsp;collecting soil and rock samples in 2021,
                            storing them in small tubes, and depositing them on the surface for future return to
                            Earth.&nbsp;Japan's MMX
                            mission will launch in 2024&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring samples of Mars'
                            moon&nbsp;Phobos,&nbsp;which&nbsp;are likely to contain diverse bits and pieces from across
                            Mars
                            thrown into orbit by meteorites.</p>
                        <p>Sending scientists directly to Mars remains the ultimate goal for
                            Mars exploration. A human in a spacesuit would be able to move, collect
                            samples, and make decisions much more quickly than a robot being
                            controlled from Earth, where the average
                            round-trip time to send and receive rover signals is 25 minutes. A first step in sending
                            humans to Mars would be, simply placing them in orbit,
                            where they could control rovers on the surface in real-time.</p>
